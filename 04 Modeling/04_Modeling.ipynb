    "Undersampling techniques can be used when we have large data (tens of thousands of records for the less dominant class is generally enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "As this isn't the case for us, we can go for Oversampling techniques which are better suited for a relatively smaller dataset, a few hundred or a few thousand records of the rarer class. Similar effect to Oversampling can be achieved using weighting techniques present in many classification algorithms. We have made use of these weighting techniques in our classifiers above to handle imbalanced data.\n",
